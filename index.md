## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, part 1

    I liked this lab because it is my first ever interactive program in C++. I learned how to use the most common statements, "std::cout" and "std::cin" and to get the user's input and apply it in the code, which was a huge accomplishment for a beginner. At first, it was challenging, but after I got the hang of it, I saw how easy it was.

* Lab 4, part 2

    This is my favorite lab because I enjoyed creating the program, which was a simple game, and also enjoyed playing it. I learned how to use "if" and "if else" statements properly, which I think is important because it is used in many labs.

* Lab 7, part 1

    I liked this lab because I enjoyed creating the program and also because it seems like a useful program for real life. I learned how to use ".size," operators, and how to write error functions with, "return 1." in this lab.
